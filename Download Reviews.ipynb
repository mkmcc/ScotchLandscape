Lightly smoky, with some light coastal/briny notes. As is reputed, has a bit of everything.\n",

That said, it does it in a refined, gentlemanly sort of way, instead of having some characteristics that really jump out and make this memorable in the way that an Ardbeg or sherry bomb Glendronach would.
