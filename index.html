  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>
  If you&rsquo;ve ever met a craft beer enthusiast, you probably know
  that beer can be <i>very complicated</i>: there are different malts,
  hops, and styles to choose from, and there are also strong opinions
  to accompany each choice&hellip; it can take a bit of experimenting
  to learn your preferences.
  </p>

  <p>
  Scotch whisky is essentially distilled beer, and distillation adds
  layers to this complexity: connoisseurs describe scotches with a
  language every bit as extensive (and every bit as inscrutable) as
  the language used to describe red wines.  This makes it a bit of a
  challenge to break into the scotch world and to learn what you like
  &mdash; especially since a bottle of scotch lasts a long time and
  mistakes can be expensive!
  </p>

  <p>
  Exploring a large parameter space like this one is a good
  application for machine learning&hellip; I can have my laptop crunch
  through thousands of scotch reviews and find any dominant patterns
  in the tasting notes.  I&rsquo;ll take scotch reviews from the
  (impressively active)
  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/">Scotch SubReddit</a> and
  attempt to distill this information into something you can use to
  explore and compare scotches at a glance.
  </p>

  <p>
  I took the 200 most reviewed scotches, and for each of them
  downloaded ten reviews from Reddit&rsquo;s most prolific reviewers.
  (I use a reviewer&rsquo;s productivity as a proxy for experience,
  and therefore reliability&hellip; mistaking quantity for quality is
  a common and fraught error, and I&rsquo;m quilty of it here.)  Then,
  for each scotch I count up the number of words in different note
  categories like the following:
  </p>

  <p>
  <table>
  <tr valign="top">
    <th align="left">honey</th>
    <td>honey honeyed honeysuckle baklava</td>
  </tr>

  <tr valign="top">
    <th align="left">raisin</th>
    <td>grape grapes grapey sultanas sultana raisin raisins date dates
      fig figgy figs prune prunes</td>
  </tr>

  <tr valign="top">
    <th align="left">beer</th>
    <td>malt malty maltier maltiest barley beer wheat wheated
      sourdough bread bready cracker crackers hops oatmeal pastry
      popcorn porridge toast toasted cereal</td>
  </tr>

  <tr valign="top">
    <th align="left">hay</th>
    <td>hay grass grassiness grassy straw</td>
  </tr>

  <tr valign="top">
    <th align="left">bakery</th>
    <td>graham shortbread cookie cookies cake muffin biscuit biscuits
      baked bakery</td>
  </tr>

  <tr valign="top">
    <th align="left">sea</th>
    <td>marine maritime fish kelp seashells sea seashore seawater
      seaweed ocean oceany salmon</td>
  </tr>

  <tr valign="top">
    <th align="left">&hellip;</th>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  </table>
  </p>

  <p>
  For each scotch, this tally represents a sort of
  &ldquo;fingerprint&rdquo; for the traits defining that scotch.  We
  can run a few machine-learning algorithms on these fingerprints and
  see what patterns we can tease out from all these reviews:
  </p>

  <h3>KMeans Cluster Analysis:</h3>

  <p>
  After tallying each of these traits for each scotch, the simplest
  thing I can do is to run a KMeans analysis to look for clusters
  &mdash; each cluster should contain a number of scotches with
  similar traits.  The KMeans algorithm won&rsquo;t actually identify
  the <i>number</i> of clusters&hellip; that&rsquo;s a bit arbitrary,
  and must be specified by hand.  I&rsquo;ll try looking for (say)
  nine distinct clusters:
  </p>

  <p>
  <table>
    <tr> <th> group 1: </th> <td>  wine, sugar, vanilla, fruit, sherry </td> </tr>
    <tr> <th> group 2: </th> <td>  sherry, sugar, oak, fruit, spice    </td> </tr>
    <tr> <th> group 3: </th> <td>  peat, sugar, smoke, vanilla, salt   </td> </tr>
    <tr> <th> group 4: </th> <td>  oak, vanilla, sherry, apple, fruit  </td> </tr>
    <tr> <th> group 5: </th> <td>  vanilla, peat, smoke, salt, sugar   </td> </tr>
    <tr> <th> group 6: </th> <td>  sherry, vanilla, oak, sugar, fruit  </td> </tr>
    <tr> <th> group 7: </th> <td>  vanilla, sugar, apple, oak, honey   </td> </tr>
    <tr> <th> group 8: </th> <td>  sherry, peat, sugar, smoke, vanilla </td> </tr>
    <tr> <th> group 9: </th> <td>  vanilla, easy, honey, citrus, beer  </td> </tr>
  </table>
  </p>

  <p>
  You might use this to, e.g., take a scotch you know you like, and
  then find other scotches from the same group.  Unfortunately, the
  meaning of these groups isn&rsquo;t especially illuminating, at
  least not to me.  And I&rsquo;m a bit skeptical of this analysis,
  since traits which I&rsquo;d expect to go together (such
  as <i>wine</i> and <i>sherry</i> or <i>peat</i> and <i>smoke</i>)
  seem uncorrelated.  We can better explore these correlations using
  a <i>principal component analysis</i>.
  </p>

</div> <!-- end section 1 -->


<div class="section" id="section2">
  <h2>Principal Component Analysis</h2>

  <p>
  The principal component analysis attempts to identify the most
  salient qualities separating the different types of scotches.
  </p>

  <p>
  Here is a scatter plot showing the various principal components for
  each scotch, colored by the region of origin.  If you take a look at
  the middle plot in the top row, you can see that the principal
  components 1 and 2 separate the scotch-producing regions quite well,
  with the smoky Islay scotches in one bunch toward the lower-left and
  the lighter Speyside scotches fanning out across the other side.
  The histograms along the diagonal show that Islay and Island
  scotches are similar, typically having negative values of PC1 and
  PC2, while the Highland and Speyside scotches are fairly similar and
  skew toward more positive values of PC1 and PC2.  In terms
  of <i>interpretation</i>, neither PC1 or PC2 seem likely to be
  all-that helpful, but a line cutting across the diagonal of this
  plot seems promising!
  </p>

  <p>
  If you look in the third column, you can also see that the third
  principal component adds essentially no distinguishing power, at
  least for traits which correlate with the scotch&rsquo;s region of
  origin.
  </p>

  <p>
  <img src="static/pca-by-region.png"></img>
  </p>

  <p>
  We can also see how these principal components segregate the
  different Kmeans clusters.  Again, PC1 and PC2 do a reasonably good
  job of segregating the different clusters &mdash; despite my earlier
  skepticism, it seems that there may be some useful information in
  these clusters after all!

  Great, so there exists <i>some</i> set of characteristics which
  separate the various scotches, but what are they?

    <p>
    One pretty clear division in the principal components above is a
    distinction between words like <i>sherry</i>, <i>grape (and
    related)</i>, and <i>fruit (or related)</i> vs. words
    like <i>vanilla</i>, <i>caramel</i>, and <i>butter (or
    related)</i>.  I take this to be a distinction between scotches
    aged in French oak (which is high in tannins, and often previously
    held sherry or wine) vs. those aged in casks made from American
    oak (which is comparatively high in vanillin and other flavor
    molecules found in coconut, stonefruit, and cloves).
    Interestingly, artificial vanilla is made from American oak.
    </p>

    <p>
    Another clear division is between peated scotches, with words
    like <i>smoke</i> and <i>peat</i> vs. unpeated scotches, described
    with words like <i>apple</i>, <i>honey</i>, and <i>heather</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Recall that the spectrum of scotches (at least by region) seemed
    to spread across a diagonal in the plot of PC1 vs PC2.  Since no
    single principal component clearly separated the different scotch
    regions, based on this intuition I&rsquo;ll define my own set of
    components to use:
    </p>

    <h3>Here are my &ldquo;modified&rdquo; principal components:</h3>

    <p>
      PC1 = 
        0.74 &times; &lsquo;sherry&rsquo;
      + 0.10 &times; &lsquo;raisin&rsquo;
      + 0.07 &times; &lsquo;berry&rsquo;
      + 0.07 &times; &lsquo;spice&rsquo;
      - 0.18 &times; &lsquo;vanilla&rsquo;
      - 0.18 &times; &lsquo;caramel&rsquo;
    </p>

    <p>
      PC2 =
        0.64 &times; &lsquo;peat&rsquo;
      + 0.41 &times; &lsquo;smoke&rsquo;
      - 0.27 &times; &lsquo;apple&rsquo;
      - 0.28 &times; &lsquo;honey&rsquo;
      - 0.28 &times; &lsquo;heather&rsquo;

  Finally, here's the plot, colored by the Kmeans cluster.  Mouse
  over to see the scotch name, price, and average rating.
  </p>

  <p>
  This is of course only a first pass at the data, and it only
  explains about half of the variation among scotches.  Differences on
  top of this seem to be much more nuanced, however: for example, a
  smoky scotch can be woody and intensely smoky like a campfire, it
  can have a sweetness that people associate with barbeque, or it can
  have an herbal quality associated with incense or tobacco;
  alternatively, if blended poorly, it can be described as ash or
  cigarette smoke.  All of these are treated as equally <i>smoky</i>
  in my map; nonetheless, I think this gives a good sense of what
  scotches are out there, and where you might be interested in
  exploring&hellip;

  <p>
  So there you have it.  This analysis is not mathematically rigorous,
  and it relies on a few subjective guesses.  Unfortunately, I&rsquo;m
  a total scotch-novice and cannot guarantee my guesses are accurate.
  However, I do think the results stand to reason&hellip; for example,
  the <i>Balvenie 12 Doublewood</i>, which is unpeated and aged in
  both American and French oak, appears roughly halway up the right
  side of the plot.  And the <i>Laphroaig 10</i>, which is heavily
  peated and aged only in American oak, appears in the lower-left
  corner.
  </p>

  <p>
  I hope you find these results helpful, and please let me know if you
  think I&rsquo;ve erred!
  </p>

  <!--
  <p>
  Assuming my conclusion that scotches are primarily divided between
  French vs. American oak and between peated vs unpeated, one could
  presumably redo this analysis with a set of more targeted traits.
  This should yield a more accurate result, but of course
  there&rsquo;s the danger of getting out the answer you put in!
